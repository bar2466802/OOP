/**
 * It compares your outputs, from the given tests directory from the Supplied Material, with the school
 * output.
 * And it also prints to the output/MyOutput.txt file your outputs.
 * You can find the school outputs for the tests in the output/SchoolOutput.txt file.
 * If you find any problem with the tests you can ask me in the tests forum.
 * I also put the update sjavac_tests.txt file with all the tests (the one from the Supplied Material was
 * missing some).
 *
 * I took the school output from the sjavac_tests.txt file and complete it with the missing test from the
 * school solution. So I assumed that the sjavac_tests.txt file results are the good ones. I also add 6 of
 * my tests.
 *
 * Instructions :
 * Just add the tests folder (its the same than the one given in the Supplied Material from the Moodle) and
 * the output folder in your project directory outside of the src directory. And add the Tester.java file in
 * the src directory. (You can see how it should be in the screenshot I joined to the post).
 * And then, you just have to run it from Intellij or the text editor you use.
 *
 * If you want to add your tests :
 * Write your tests files put them in the tests folder and then write the result from the school
 * solution in the output/SchoolOutput.txt file using this format test_name : result.
 * And then the Tester will compare your program result with the school result with the old and new tests.
 * I sort for the output/MyOutput.txt file, the tests alphabetically. So make sure to do so when adding
 * your test result with the according format like I said before.
