Book.java - This class represents a book, which has a title, author, year of publication and different literary aspects.

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the Book, Patron & Library classes with the given API who was supplied to use.
The Libray class is using the Book & Patron classes - In each library there is an array of books and an array of patrons.
When adding a new patron/book to the library we first check that he/it isn't already exist inside the relevant array & that we still have room inside according to the library capacity.



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
For each patron we are keeping a counter for how many books he/she is currently borrowing so he wouldn't be able to borrow more than the allowed number simultaneously.
The suggestion method is implemented using the given patron's preferences and while taking into account the 
current borrowed books by him - that way we won't recommend  a copy of a book is currently reading.
